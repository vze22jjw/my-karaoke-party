## Features

Features

🎉 Host a Party: Create a new karaoke party with a unique 4-character code.

📱 Join as a Guest: Guests can join via a simple link or QR code, with no app install required.

📺 TV/Player Mode: A dedicated player view (/player/[hash]) designed for a main screen or TV.

Security Note: When connecting manually to the player from the start page, the host must enter the 4-digit party code backwards (e.g., enter DCBA for party ABCD).

🔐 Host Controls: A password-protected host page (/host/[hash]) to manage the party.

🔍 YouTube Search: Search for any karaoke video on YouTube.

📋 Shared Queue: Songs are added to a real-time queue, visible to all guests.

⚖️ Fairness Mode: The queue automatically sorts by "fairness" to ensure everyone gets a turn and prevent singers from going back-to-back. (Can be toggled off by the host).

🎶 Song Suggestions:

Host Themes: The host can add custom theme suggestions (e.g., "80s Night").

Spotify Trends: Guests see a list of "Hot Karaoke From Spotify" for inspiration (configurable by the host).

Top Played: The queue shows the all-time most-played songs for the whole app.

🆔 Spotify Song Matching:

Automatically matches added YouTube videos to their Spotify track ID.

Aggregates "Top Played" stats by song, not by individual video.

Allows hosts to export a list of Spotify URIs to instantly create a playlist.

💬 Idle Screen Messages: Hosts can create a library of messages (quotes, lyrics, announcements) to display on the player screen when no music is playing.

⏯️ Playback Controls: Host can play, pause, and skip the current song.

💾 Backup & Restore: Save your party data to a JSON file and restore it later (or move it to another server).

🐳 Docker Ready: Fully containerized for easy deployment.

## 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)

The application supports multiple languages (currently English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Chinese).

* **Auto-Detection:** The app attempts to detect the user's browser language automatically.
* **Manual Toggle:** A language switcher is available in the footer of every page (except the Player view).
* **Configuration:**
    * Set default language: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE=en` (in `.env`)
    * Hide/Show footer toggle: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_FOOTER=true` (in `.env`)

## 🎨 Emojis Integration

To ensure a consistent, cross-platform visual experience, you can customize how emojis are rendered across different operating systems:

*   **Config File ([emoji-map.json](file:///c:/Users/vze22/.gemini/antigravity-ide/scratch/my-karaoke-party/src/config/emoji-map.json)):**
    *   **`default_style`**: Global fallback style (e.g. `"apple"`).
    *   **`variables`**: Maps role names to specific emojis (e.g. `"host_emoji_1": "👑"`, `"singer_emoji_7": "🍺"`). Changing these values updates the emoji globally throughout the app without modifying code.
    *   **`styles`**: Maps variable names to style sets (e.g. `"host_emoji_1": "google"`, `"singer_emoji_7": "whatsapp"`).
*   **Environment Override:** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMOJI_SET` in your `.env` to override the default style. Supported styles include any of the 30 sets provided by `oddmario/emoji-cdn` (e.g. `apple`, `google`, `whatsapp`, `samsung`, `facebook`, `joypixels-animations`), shorthand keywords (`fluent`, `twemoji`, `noto`), or a custom CDN script/font URL.
*   **Fail-Safe Native Fallback:** Emojis are loaded dynamically. If the CDN is down, slow, or offline, the browser immediately swaps the failed image out and displays the OS native emoji character, avoiding any layout shift.

💻 100% Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS for development and hosting.

💾 Data Retention & Storage

This application is designed to keep your party history forever. The automatic cleanup jobs have been disabled.

Why?
The data footprint of this application is extremely small. Since we only store text metadata (YouTube links, song titles, singer names) and not the actual video/audio files, the database grows very slowly.

The Math:
A typical party with 20 singers performing 6 songs each takes up approximately ~92 KB of database space.
Even on a free-tier database (e.g., 256 MB limit), you would need to host:

~2,700 Parties

Or host a monthly party for 225 Years

...before running out of space. Keeping the data allows you to maintain "All-Time" stats, leaderboards, and memories without cost concerns.

📦 Backup & Restore

Found in the Settings tab of the Host Controls.

Backup: Downloads a .json file containing all parties, singers, songs, and idle messages currently in the database.

Restore: Upload a previously saved .json file. The system will restore any parties that do not currently exist in the database (it skips duplicates based on the Party Hash).

This feature is useful for migrating data between servers or keeping local archives.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- Docker (for PostgreSQL)

### Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/flaviokosta79/my-karaoke-party.git](https://github.com/flaviokosta79/my-karaoke-party.git)
    cd my-karaoke-party
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Setup environment variables**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit `.env` and fill in:
    - `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
    - `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` - YouTube Data API v3 key
    - `ADMIN_TOKEN` - A password of your choice to protect host pages.
    - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` (Optional) - For Spotify features
    - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` (Optional) - For Spotify features

4.  **Start everything with one command** 🚀

    **Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    pnpm dev:full
    ```

    **Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev:full:sh
    ```

    This will automatically:
    - ✅ Start PostgreSQL in Docker
    - ✅ Sync database schema
    - ✅ Start the development server

5.  **Open your browser**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🤖 AI Assistance Disclaimer

Please note that recent updates and refinements to this project were developed with the assistance of **Google Gemini**. The AI provided guidance on code structure, editing, and documentation to help improve the application. I absolutely appriecate the fork of this project and ensured the spirit of this project remained the same but adpated to my karaoke party needs. Good luck.
